## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

<p align="center"> Our Project Idea matching the open sooq website, our users have the permession to post their own product on the website to allow other users to see their products, and contact them if they like the product to buy it. All users can see all products in the website and they can contact the seller to start the negotiations on the product's price. The frontend of this application has been written by React.js  and css.the backend has been written by javascript using Node.js and expressjs. This aplication is built to allow any user to see the products,but he cant do any action except contact the sellers untill he get an account on the website. all of this handled by backend/node.js.
